**Intro**

<p> 
This application was a collaboration between myself and other team members for CMPT 373 - Software Development Methods at Simon Fraser University. My commits are under rcmcg, reecem, or Reece McGowan.
</p>

<p>
An application for managing mentor/mentee relationships at the Baytree
Centre in London. There are 3 components to the application. The
<b>user-frontend</b> is seen by the mentor when they want to upload information regarding mentoring sessions or access resources. The <b>admin-frontend</b> allows an administrator at Baytree to manage accounts, access statistics, etc. The backend is used to receive and process API requests from the frontends as well as manage the database.
</p>

**User-Frontend**
<p>
Make sure you have Node Package Manager installed before attempting to run the user-frontend. To start the user-frontend, change directory to user-frontend in your terminal. Then enter npm install in terminal. Then enter npm start. The application should start in a browser.  
</p>

**Admin-Frontend**
<p>
Make sure you have Node Package Manager installed before attempting to run the admin-frontend. To start the admin-frontend, change directory to admin-frontend in your terminal. Then enter npm install in terminal. Then enter npm start. The application should start in a browser.
